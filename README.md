Funky Friday Autoplayer (AND GAMES SIMILAR TO IT!!)

From BArt33k, and WallyRBLX:
print("Credits to mstudio45 for the ported UI lib of Linoria")
print("Credits to Wally-RBLX and his devs for making this amazing script")
print("I [BArt33k] DO NOT OWN ANY OF THIS CODE. CREDITS TO THIS CODE AND UI LIBS ETC GO TO THEIR OWNERS.")
print(" ")
print("Wally RBLX's Funky Friday AutoPlay script mobile port. (READ LINES ABOVE!)")

This is my version of it.
```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SuperCode747/funky-autoplay/refs/heads/main/script.lua",true))()
```
